This web application leverages 23 and Me data to produce various health risks in chart format. Additionally, the tool is an application that can be used to track restaurants and specific foods that did not make me feel well. Eventually, this application produces a list of food and restaurants, derived from my dietary needs (and energy level), providing a list of good foods to eat, restaurants to enjoy, etc. 

Several key components to addres are as follows:
What foods can affect your appetite, your digestive system  
Interactive binary/boolean model based on what you eat 
Forecast an appropriate (carbs, fat, protein) or overall diet breakdown
Mapping local Yelp restaurants/specific items on Whole Foods app/linking general recipes based on likes + avoid foods that irritate 


As a user...  
I want to log in 
I want to ensure only certain people have access to my content 
I want to upload 23&me data in a particular format 
I want to provide a link my doctor could click on and see my 23&me, risk factors, and journal of restaurants  
I want to track locations where food made me feel sick and create a list of restaurants to avoid with particular items 
I want to know Location (as it relates to stress) or Water quality at water fountain after feeling sick 
I want the web application to be mobile ready 
I want to use a database to remember specific foods or restaurants that made me sick 
If possible, I would like a network of restaurants that made others with similar issues sick (if I say I gluten sensitive, I want to know what restaurants in an area may adhere to gluten sensitivity. User driven) 
I want to upload photos of food 
I want to upload restaurant lists 
I want a GUI  
I want to upload notes, date specific 
I want to edit and delete notes but I may not want the data base to overwrite old notes 
I want to upload photos of myself for an avatar (profile photo) 
I want charts of 23&me data 
I want a matrix of 23&me data with key findings of these attributes 
If possible, restaurants and past foods should auto populate as journal is updated
